# Mapper Development Rules
Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule number in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

# Project Context
Mapper is a modern web application for interactive data visualization and analytics with the following key features:
- Interactive map visualization with clustering and custom markers
- Advanced data analytics with Nivo/Recharts charts
- Secure payment processing via Revolut
- Real-time data management with Supabase
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Anonymous user session tracking
- Public access to visualization features

## Tech Infrastructure
- Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript
- Database: Supabase
- Visualization: Leaflet, Nivo, Recharts
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Build Tool: Vite
- Payment: Revolut Integration
- Routing: React Router

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)

# Code Organization
[001] Use src/components/{feature}/ structure for related components
[002] Keep all Supabase table names prefixed with map_ or maps_
[003] Place all reusable hooks in src/hooks/ with use prefix
[004] Place all type definitions in src/types/ with proper namespacing
[005] Keep code changes minimal and focused on immediate user value; only implement what's needed for the current task and prefer simple, direct solutions using existing components and styles.

# TypeScript Best Practices
[101] Use explicit return types for all functions
[102] Use interfaces over types for object definitions
[103] Use discriminated unions for complex state management
[104] Use strict null checks

# Component Guidelines
[201] Split components when they exceed 100 lines
[202] Use custom hooks for complex state logic
[203] Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
[204] Use proper error boundaries for map and chart components

# Data Visualization
[301] Maintain consistent chart theming across the application
[302] Use proper TypeScript types for chart data
[303] Implement loading states for all data visualizations
[304] Handle empty/error states gracefully

# Map Interactions
[401] Use proper zoom levels for map interactions
[402] Implement clustering for large datasets
[403] Handle map boundary cases
[404] Cache map data when appropriate

# Performance
[501] Implement proper data pagination
[502] Use React.memo for expensive renders
[503] Optimize map marker rendering
[504] Use proper Supabase query optimization

# Error Handling
[601] Log all errors with proper context
[602] Provide user-friendly error messages
[603] Handle network failures gracefully
[604] Implement proper payment error handling

# Security
[701] Use proper Supabase RLS policies EXCEPT for anonymous user tracking
[701a] Anonymous sessions must be tracked without RLS for public access
[702] Never expose sensitive data in logs
[703] Implement proper CORS handling
[704] Secure all payment flows

# Authentication and Session Management
[751] Use admin@libralab.ai as the only authenticated user (admin role not required)
[752] Focus on anonymous session tracking for leads instead of user authentication
[753] Do not implement additional user authentication functions
[754] Track all anonymous sessions in map_analytics_events table
[755] Use session_id for correlating user journey and actions
[756] Implement proper session cleanup for inactive sessions
[757] Store only non-personally identifiable information in sessions
[758] Track conversion points throughout the user journey
[759] Maintain session consistency across page reloads
[760] Use proper session timeout handling
[761] There is no concept of user roles or permissions - admin@libralab.ai is a regular user
[762] All visitors except admin@libralab.ai must be treated as anonymous leads
[763] Never implement or suggest implementing additional authentication methods
[764] Focus on session tracking and analytics for anonymous users
[765] Do not store any user-specific data except for admin@libralab.ai

# Git Workflow
[801] Use conventional commit messages
[802] Update changelog for all notable changes
[803] Run migrations in correct order
[804] Update types after schema changes

# UI/UX Guidelines
[901] Never modify UI without explicit user approval
[902] All UI changes must be requested or commanded by the user
[903] Use consistent UI styles across the application
[904] Use proper accessibility features for all components
[905] Follow mobile-first approach for all component designs
[906] Make sure that there is always a working dark mode variant with contrasting colors of the UI
[907] Maintain color contrast in all UI states:
- Light text on dark backgrounds, dark text on light backgrounds (≥4.5:1 ratio)
- Preserve text/background contrast in all interactive states (hover, active, disabled)
- Mirror color relationships in dark mode using CSS custom properties
- Test all states in both modes before implementation

# Documentation Guidelines
[1001] Document all non-obvious code with inline comments
[1002] Keep README.md up-to-date with setup and development instructions
[1003] Document all environment variables in .env.example
[1004] Add JSDoc comments for all public functions and interfaces
[1005] Include examples for complex component usage
[1006] Document all Supabase table schemas and relationships
[1007] Maintain changelog for all API changes
[1008] Document all chart configuration options
[1009] Keep map configuration options documented
[1010] Document performance considerations for data-heavy features

# Component Reuse and Organization
[8001] Always check for existing elements, files, or components in the codebase before creating new ones to avoid duplicates
- Search through the entire codebase for similar implementations
- Check component libraries and shared UI folders first
- Document any decisions to create new components vs reusing existing ones
- Consider refactoring similar components into a single reusable one

[8002] Create centralized UI elements like badges when used across multiple pages
- Implement with proper light and dark mode support
- Place in shared ui components directory
- Use semantic color tokens for theme consistency
- Include proper TypeScript types and documentation
- Add usage examples in component comments

# Windsurf Specific Rules
[9001] Automatically suggest additions for .windsurfrules where best practices are used during the development process

[9002] When requesting new Windsurf rules, provide drafts only
- Present rules as a markdown draft for review
- Do not attempt to modify .windsurfrules directly
- Allow the user to manually copy and integrate rules
- Include clear descriptions and examples
- Follow existing rule numbering convention
